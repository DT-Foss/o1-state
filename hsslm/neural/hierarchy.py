"""
Hierarchical Composer - multi-level linguistic representation builder.

Maps token-level SSM hidden states to increasingly abstract representations
at word, phrase, sentence, and discourse levels. Each composer uses a
learned 2-layer MLP with residual connection to transform pooled states.

The hierarchical pipeline:
    Token States (B, L, D)
        | WordComposer (mean-pool + MLP)
    Word States (B, W, D)
        | PhraseComposer (local attention + MLP)
    Phrase States (B, P, D)
        | SentenceComposer (max-pool + MLP)
    Sentence States (B, S, D)
        | DiscourseComposer (gated recurrence + MLP)
    Discourse States (B, S, D)
